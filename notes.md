for MVP 5 stateless components:
- filter users
- nav bar logged in:
    - profile
    - logout

for show page (profile):
- add button to like and dislike
    - like will add to friends list
- add delete option

for all users:
- if time, try to implement deck of cards


create messages container (DO THIS LAST):
- form that will email user (does not actually need to submit to anything just for show)
